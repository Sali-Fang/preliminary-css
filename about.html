<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr \>

<p>👋 Hi there! I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student with a passion for learning, building, and pushing limits—both mentally and physically.<br \>

  💻 Currently diving deep into computer networks, web design, and ethical hacking (CEH). I’m fluent in Python and C++, and always eager to expand my programming toolkit.<br \>
  
  🥋 Outside the tech world, I train in Muay Thai—where discipline, endurance, and precision matter. That same mindset fuels my approach to coding: I don’t stop until the job is done.<br \>
  
  🔧 To support myself, I work as a butcher, specializing in boneless meat preparation. It’s hands-on, intense, and oddly satisfying—just like debugging a stubborn piece of code.<br \>
  
  🌍 Native Persian speaker, learning English as my second language (currently at intermediate level). I believe that growth comes from stepping outside your comfort zone, and I live that every day.<br \>
  
  📚 Whether it’s tech, languages, or martial arts—I’m always learning, always improving. Thanks for stopping by my GitHub!<br \>
